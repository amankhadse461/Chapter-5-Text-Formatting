    <p> p tag is used for paragraph</p>
    <!-- example -->
    <p>To print something on the console, print() function is used. This function also adds a newline after our message is printed(unlike in C). Note that in <mark>Python 2,</mark> “print” is not a function but a keyword and therefore can be used without parentheses. However, in Python 3, it is a function and must be invoked with parentheses.</p>
